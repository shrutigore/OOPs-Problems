/* A yard is a unit where trains undergo the cleaning and other technical maintenance.
A yard is empty at the end of a day. One train (UP4053) arrives in the yard. 
Then one more train (DN3021) arrives in the yard. Like this, five trains arrive in the yard. (DN4067, UP1025, UP2024)
Now, one train goes out from the yard (UP1025). Then one more train goes out from the yard (UP2024). 
Check if a train with number DN3768 is present in the yard. Display its status. Display all the trains present in the yard. 
In short, the arrival of trains in the yard and the departure of trains from the yard happens all across the day.
